        <div class="content">Since the invention of the world wide web in 1989, the way we live, communicate and entertain ourselves has been changed forever. The web became a global solution quickly and now, you can hardly find any project that doesn’t involve the use of web powered technology.<p>Over time, the demand for web solutions increased, although this created lots of job opportunities for developers, it wasn’t very beneficial to them because the resources needed by clients weren’t technologically available at the time.</p><p>To solve this problem, different solutions like libraries and frameworks were created. These helped developers everywhere, because they could now do more with less. These tools made life easier for clients and developers alike, which has led to this question, “ If we already have new technologies and solutions, then what happens to the previous ones like libraries and frameworks? In other words, what is the future of web frameworks?”</p>
          <center><div class="fun-fact"><h3><b>FUN FACT:</b></h3>Before we go further, you might be wondering what frameworks are. “ A programming framework is a prepackaged set of solutions that solves common development problems.” ~ Carlos Schults (<a href="makemeaprogrammer.com"> MakeMeAProgrammer.com </a>)

        <div class="content"><p>Looking at our timeline, we can see similarities between past and present events. Each new solution produced is just an ‘ improvement ‘ from the previous one. i.e Frameworks were created because although libraries were great, they didn’t provide full flexibility and ease while creating solutions, which led to unnecessary time consumption trying to create tools that frameworks offer by default. 
        Over the course of years, a lot has changed from the ordinary white and black websites we used to see back in the 90’s. 
         The number of developers producing web solutions have rapidly increased meaning web frameworks still have a bright future. My opinion on this topic is - web frameworks are here to stay, for at least 5 to 10 more years, because as long as there are developers, there would be solutions for developers to use to provide services for clients. As I also said earlier, every new solution is an improvement of the previous one, so frameworks would undoubtedly improve and set a new pace for the next generation of solutions for developers to use.
